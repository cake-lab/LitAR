This is the official code release for LitAR which was published in IMWUT (UbiComp) 2022.

**TL;DR**: LitAR can improve the rendering quality for Mobile AR applications via accurate and near real-time lighting estimation. LitAR's improved lighting estimation over existing methods is achieved through lightweight 3D reconstruction and edge-assisted computing. ðŸ˜„

## Directory Structure

- `server`: contains server-side code and relevant information for reproducing the server-side experimental results.
- `client`: contains an Unity3D-based application. This application was developed using LitAR client/server APIs, and can be used for reproducing the remaining experimental results.

We provide detailed instructions for reproducing results in `README.md` files in both the `server` and `client` directories.
